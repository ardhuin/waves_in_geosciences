On the cover: swell waves from extratropical storm Rosemary resolved by SWOT at the location of the SOFS mooring, South of Australia, along track 19, on 9 June 2023. The right panel uses the Ocean Virtual Laboratory developed by Oceandatalab to provide context for these wave observations: SWOT-derived currents, and other satellite altimeter wave heights (\url{https://odl.bzh/WjEKPhZa}). Such long waves waves are generated by the winds of the most powerful storm, and propagate across ocean basins where they are are also influenced by currents and sea ice. More details on this example in Ardhuin et al. (2024).

\chapter*{Foreword}\label{foreword}
There are countless scholarly articles and books about ocean waves, with many different points of view, going from 
mathematical treatises to naval architecture. Among these we can single out the excellent textbooks by 
\cite{Kinsman1965}, \cite{Dean&Dalrymple1991},  
and \cite{Holthuijsen2007}, the engineering manual from the \cite{USACE2002}, and many excellent scientific 
monographs by \cite{Phillips1977}, \cite{Dingemans1997a}, \cite{Young1999}, \cite{Lavrenov2003}, \cite{Janssen2004}, \cite{Lannes2013} ...  

So why another one? 

First of all, scientific developments never stop, making these previous works not obsolete but less up to date 
and complete. This will happen with the present book, even if I am trying to update it on a regular basis. The parts 1 and 2 
and the associated teaching material (jupyter notebooks ...)  is designed to be at the level of Master students in oceanography. 

Second, and more important, all these books, except possibly the jewel by \cite{Phillips1977} have a rather narrow 
scope, and do not cover aspects for which no recent monograph exist. I particularly think about microseisms, infragravity waves or 
measurement techniques including satellite remote sensing. Some of these topics are only treated in part 3.

Working with coastal engineers, geomorphologists and seismologists, has motivated me to bring to 
the forefront those results that are often obscure or very hard to follow. My point of view is that 
ocean waves play a very particular role in the Earth System, both as an important element of air-sea or land-ocean exchanges, and also as a deforming mirror that 
modifies our measurements of ocean properties using remote sensing and even in situ techniques. As a result, much insight and cross-fertilization 
can come from the integration of many geoscientifc fields, from 
microseisms to remote sensing, as well as applied disciplines such as marine meteorology or coastal and ocean engineering.
At the very least, these different disciplines are providing new data, tools, and different points of view that complement each other 
in constraining  our physical understanding of wave processes, and the parameterizations used in numerical models or remote sensing algorithms. 

On these topics, I have tried to be clear without compromising the 
accuracy of the results, but this is a very difficult balance. If you find it unclear, do not hesitate to contact me
and I will try again to clarify in the next revision. I shall finish with a final warning:  my selection of topics is clearly biased to my own tastes and 
interests, which are clearly favouring geosciences versus engineering. It does not mean that the topics ignored here are not important. 
For example, a good discussion of 
extreme waves and sea state analysis would be much more useful for all engineers 
than our development on three-dimensional wave-current interactions. For this you may go to section 4.3 of \cite{Holthuijsen2007} or, with more details, to \cite{Boccotti2000}.
I hope that the present book will be a good combination 
of useful and interesting topics. \\

\vspace{0.5cm}
The document is organized in two parts, one relevant to waves in deep water, another providing additional 
information on coastal and shallow water aspects, and both are complemented by a separate book, which contains a third part that goes into some details that are probably not relevant for 
most readers in particular Master students. This book is designed to make it easier to read in electronic form, including hypertext links within the document 
and towards outside sources, such as the cited references. It is designed as a teaching material for the wave-related Master courses 
at University of Brest and ENSTA-Paris Tech. Because the present document is trying to follow the latest 
advances in research -- and my imperfect understanding of these. The permanent evolution unfortunately leads to the presence of errors, more so in part III. 
I thank 
Nicolas Rascle, Nadine Paugam, Clément Gandon, Nobuhiro Suzuki, Sophia Brumer, Marine De Carlo and Oyvind Brevik for many corrections, Jean-Fran{\c c}ois Filipot for contributions and help in translating chapter 3, and 
Philippe Bonneton for discussions and help on the structure and contents of chapter \ref{ch_surf}.  
%This version is still not finished and some (old) parts in chapter 22-26 are still in French and will be translated in the coming months. OK, months may be years as I've been writing this for about ten years, but I'm not giving up hope.
I thank you in advance for finding any dubious or strange contents, or broken links.
